## SMS-MAGIC
Here, we import the necessary modules from Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy.
Flask is used to create the Flask application instance.
request allows us to access incoming request data.
jsonify is used to convert Python dictionaries into JSON responses.
SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Python, used for database interactions in Flask applications.

#### Entities (Step 2):

Three entities are defined using SQLAlchemy: User, Company, and Client.
These entities represent the main components of the application: users, companies, and clients.
Each entity is defined as a class inheriting from db.Model and contains attributes that represent the columns in the corresponding database table.

#### SQL Functions (Step 3):

Functions are defined to perform custom SQL queries related to companies and clients.
For example, search_companies_by_employees_range, search_clients_by_user, and search_clients_by_name perform database queries based on specific criteria.

#### Security (Step 4):

The create_client endpoint is secured to allow only users with the ROLE_ADMIN role to access it.
It checks the user's role in the request header and returns a 403 Forbidden error if the role is not ROLE_ADMIN.

#### Regex Validation (Step 5):

The get_user_profile endpoint fetches the user profile from the database and validates the email format using a regular expression (regex).
If the email format is invalid, it returns a 400 Bad Request error with an error message.

#### Unit and/or Functional Tests (Step 6):

Unit tests are defined using the unittest framework to test various aspects of the API.
Test cases include checking company employee count, ensuring that ROLE_USER cannot create a user, testing client creation, and verifying companies' revenue.

#### Tests.py File:

The tests.py file contains the unit and/or functional tests for the API.
It defines test cases using the unittest.TestCase class and includes methods to test different aspects of the API endpoints.

#### Main_script.py File:

The main script contains the application code, including route definitions, entity models, and security/validation logic.
It imports the TestAPI class from tests.py to run the unit and/or functional tests.
In summary, this code defines a Flask API with endpoints for managing users, companies, and clients. It includes database models, custom SQL functions, security measures, input validation using regex, and unit/functional tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of the API. The tests.py file contains test cases to validate the behavior of the API endpoints
